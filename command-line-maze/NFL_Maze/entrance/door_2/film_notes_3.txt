FILM STUDY — SITUATIONAL FOOTBALL

Situational awareness separates good teams from great ones.
The clock, field position, and score all influence decision-making.

Two-score games change defensive priorities. Offenses may
be willing to concede short completions if it keeps the clock moving.
Defenses adjust alignment based on boundary, hash, and sideline access.

End-of-half scenarios are rehearsed weekly. Communication
becomes the most important skill when crowd noise increases
and tempo accelerates.

Timeout management is critical. Each timeout represents
a potential possession. Poor usage can remove entire
sections of the playbook late in halves.

In the two-minute situation, defenses prioritize the sideline
and force throws into the middle of the field.
Offenses value tempo, clean completions, and immediate alignment.

Mistakes are magnified when the clock is the opponent.
