FILM STUDY — OFFENSE

Pre-snap identification is critical. The quarterback must identify
the defensive front, the number of down linemen, and the alignment
of second-level defenders before the snap. Motion is often used
to confirm coverage, particularly when defenses disguise man and zone.

Route spacing matters more than speed in most concepts. Receivers
must understand leverage and how defenders are coached to play
certain route combinations. Concepts such as mesh, flood, and dagger
rely on timing and spacing rather than raw athleticism.

Protection schemes determine whether a play can develop.
Slide protection, man protection, and max protect all change
how the quarterback reads the field. Pressure does not need
to result in a sack to be effective — forcing early throws
is often enough.

Good offenses stay ahead of the chains. Second-and-short
opens the entire playbook. Third-and-long limits options
and increases defensive aggression.

Play sequencing matters. Successful offenses often run
plays not to gain yards immediately, but to set up future looks.
A run may be used to influence linebacker fits later in the game.

Red zone offense is a different game entirely. Windows shrink,
defensive backs play more aggressively, and quarterback decision-making
must speed up. Touchdowns require precision, not volume.
