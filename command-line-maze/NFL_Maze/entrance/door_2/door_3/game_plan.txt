GAME PLAN — WEEKLY PREPARATION

The game plan outlines tendencies, personnel groupings,
and expected defensive looks.

It includes first-15 scripts, red zone packages,
and situational calls for third down.

While game plans evolve throughout the week,
they are ultimately constrained by what opponents show on film.

Execution matters, but preparation alone does not guarantee success.
