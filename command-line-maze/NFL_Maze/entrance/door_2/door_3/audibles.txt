AUDIBLES AND ADJUSTMENTS

Audibles allow quarterbacks to adjust plays at the line of scrimmage
based on defensive alignment.

They rely on trust, communication, and shared understanding
between the quarterback and skill position players.

Great teams execute audibles cleanly,
but audibles only react to what is already visible.
