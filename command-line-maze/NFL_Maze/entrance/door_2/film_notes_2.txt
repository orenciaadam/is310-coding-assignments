FILM STUDY — DEFENSE

Defensive structure is built around limiting explosive plays.
Safeties are taught to keep the ball in front of them and force
offenses to execute consistently over long drives.

Pre-snap disguise is one of the most effective defensive tools.
Late safety rotation can turn a simple read into a hesitation.
Even a half-second delay can allow pressure to arrive.

Linebacker depth and eye discipline reveal coverage intentions.
In zone concepts, linebackers relate to threats entering their area.
In man coverage, leverage and trail technique become more important.

Pass rush lanes are more important than individual wins.
Edge rushers must keep quarterbacks contained while interior
rushers collapse the pocket. Blitzing without lane integrity
often leads to scramble opportunities.

Tackling efficiency determines defensive success on early downs.
Missed tackles turn manageable plays into explosive gains.
Defenses that tackle well force offenses into predictable situations.

Third down defense is about matchups. Defensive coordinators
scheme pressure and coverage based on tendencies shown earlier
in the game. Winning third down often determines time of possession.

Elite defenses win before the snap by forcing the quarterback
to process too much information at once.
