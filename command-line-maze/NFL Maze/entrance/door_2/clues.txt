Real teams study film.

One of the film notes contains the key phrase that 
unlocks the next door.

Search the film notes for the phrase: 
two-minute

Go through the door number that matches
the film notes number where you find it. 

Hint: There is a command that lets you
search for a word or phrase inside multiple
files at once. Use it to search the film notes.
