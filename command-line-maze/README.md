# Road to the Superbowl: An NFL Command Line Maze
Adam Orencia

## Overview
This maze explores NFL culture through the structure of the
regular season, playoffs, and team preparation. Your goal is to 
navigate the maze using command-line tools only
and find your way to the championship. 

## How to solve
You should complete the maze using only the command line. 
Do not use a file explorer or code editor to navigate the folders.

Read clues carefully and explore files and directories to determine
the correct path forward. Some paths may look useful but
will not lead you closer to the solution. 

If you reach a dead end, you may need to turn back and try
a different approach.

## Where to start 
Begin in the `entrance/` directory.

Good luck.
